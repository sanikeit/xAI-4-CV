## Lecture 1: Introduction to XAI

### 1.1 Course Overview

**What is Explainable AI (XAI)?**
- XAI refers to AI systems that are transparent in their operations, allowing human users to understand and trust decisions
- Goal: Create models where humans can understand the cause of a decision
- Key principle: Explanations must be faithful to the model AND understandable by humans

**Definition by Tim Miller (2017):**
> "Interpretability is the degree to which a human can understand the cause of a decision."

### 1.2 Why Do We Need Explainability?

#### 1.2.1 Bias Detection

- Example: "This is a dog because it has four legs, fur, etc."

**Model-Faithful Explanations**
- Represent actual model decision-making process
- Example: "This is a dog because pixel (X,Y) has value Z"
- May not align with human intuition but accurately represents model behavior

### 2.2 Machine Learning Ecosystem Roles

#### 2.2.1 Agent Types (Tomsett et al. Framework)

**Creators**

### 2.3 Properties of Explanation Methods

#### 2.3.1 Method Properties

**Expressive Power**
- "Language" or structure of explanations
- Examples: IF-THEN rules, decision trees, weighted sums, attribution maps

**Translucency**
- Level of access to model internals
- High: Full access to parameters and gradients
- Low: Only input-output access (black-box)

**Portability**
- Range of ML models the method can explain
- Low translucency → High portability
- Model-specific methods have low portability

**Algorithmic Complexity**
- Computational cost of explanation method
- Important for real-time applications

#### 2.3.2 Individual Explanation Properties

**Fidelity**
- How accurately the explanation represents the model
- Most important property for trustworthy explanations
- Can be local (single instance) or global (entire model)

**Stability**
- Consistency of explanations for similar instances
- High stability: similar inputs → similar explanations
- Low stability may indicate method variance or model non-determinism

**Comprehensibility**
- How well humans understand the explanations
- Difficult to define and measure objectively
- Critical for practical adoption

**Certainty**
- Whether explanation reflects model confidence
- Should indicate when model is uncertain

**Novelty**
- Explanation's ability to handle out-of-distribution data
- Related to certainty (high novelty ↔ low certainty)

**Representativeness**
- Scope of explanation coverage
- Global: explains entire model behavior
- Local: explains individual predictions

### 2.4 What Makes a Good Explanation?

#### 2.4.1 Human-Centered Principles

**Contrastive Nature**
- Humans ask "Why this instead of that?"
- Explanations should highlight differences between alternatives

**Selectivity**
- Humans don't want complete reasoning
- Good explanations are concise and focused

**Social Interaction**
- Explanations are communication between explainer and recipient
- Must be tailored to the audience

**Focus on Abnormal**
- Humans focus on unusual causes
- Abnormal features should be highlighted in explanations

**Truthfulness**
- Explanations must be faithful to the model
- Trade-off between fidelity and comprehensibility

**Prior Belief Consistency**
- Good explanations align with recipient's prior knowledge
- Conflicting explanations may be devalued due to confirmation bias

**Generality and Probability**
- General explanations that cover many cases are preferred
- In absence of abnormal events, general explanations are better

## Lecture 3: Backpropagation-Based Pixel Attributions

### 3.1 Pixel Attribution Definition

**Goal**: Highlight how relevant each input pixel is for the final prediction

**Applications**:
- Detecting biases and model misbehavior
- Understanding model decision mechanisms
- Building trust through transparency

### 3.2 Gradient-Based Methods

#### 3.2.1 Vanilla Gradient (Saliency Maps)

**Motivation**: For linear models f_c(x) = w^T_c x + b_c, the weight magnitude |w_i| defines pixel importance

**Extension to DNNs**: Use first-order Taylor expansion around input x_0:
f_c(x_0) ≈ w^T_c x_0 + b_c, where w = ∂f_c(x_0)/∂x_0

**Computation**:
1. Forward pass through network
2. Compute gradient: ∂f_c(x_0)/∂x_0
3. Optional: Take maximum magnitude across color channels

**Intuition**: If small pixel changes strongly impact output, that pixel is important

#### 3.2.2 Input × Gradient

**Formula**: IxG = x_0 ⊙ (∂f_c(x_0)/∂x_0)

**Advantages**:
- Leverages both input strength and gradient information
- Often produces cleaner visualizations than vanilla gradient
- Simple computation with element-wise multiplication

#### 3.2.3 SmoothGrad

**Problem**: Gradient-based methods are noisy due to derivative fluctuations

**Solution**: Add noise and average over multiple noisy versions

**Formula**: Â_c(x,f) = (1/n) Σ A_c(x + N(0,σ²), f)

**Parameters**:
- σ: Noise standard deviation (10-20% of input range)
- n: Number of samples (recommended: 50)

**Benefits**: Reduces noise while preserving important features

### 3.3 Class Activation Mapping (CAM)

#### 3.3.1 CAM Requirements
- Network architecture: Conv layers → Global Average Pooling → Linear layer
- Examples: ResNet-50, GoogLeNet

#### 3.3.2 CAM Computation
- Maps predicted class score back to convolutional feature maps
- Uses linear layer weights to weight feature maps
- Results in class-specific activation maps
- Requires upsampling to match input resolution

### 3.4 Grad-CAM

#### 3.4.1 Motivation
- Generalizes CAM to any CNN architecture
- Doesn't require specific architectural constraints

#### 3.4.2 Computation Steps
1. Forward pass to get class score f_c(x)
2. Compute gradients: ∂f_c(x)/∂f^(1→l)_k(x)
3. Global average pooling: α^c_k = (1/Z) Σ_i Σ_j (∂f_c(x)/∂f^(1→l)_k(x)_{i,j})
4. Linear combination: Grad-CAM_c = ReLU(Σ_k α^c_k f^(1→l)_k(x))

#### 3.4.3 Guided Grad-CAM
- Combines coarse Grad-CAM with high-resolution gradient methods
- Formula: Guided Grad-CAM_c = Grad-CAM_c ⊙ Vanilla Gradient_c
- Provides both localization and fine-grained details

### 3.5 Layer-wise Relevance Propagation (LRP)

**Key Principles**:
- Backward propagation of relevance through layers
- Conservation principle: relevance is preserved
- Uses specific decomposition rules for different layer types
- Provides pixel-wise explanations

### 3.6 Integrated Gradients (IG)

#### 3.6.1 Motivation: Axiomatic Attribution

**Problem**: Gradient saturation in neural networks
- Gradients can be near zero even when features are important
- Violates sensitivity axiom

**Axioms**:
- **Sensitivity**: Relevant features should have non-zero attribution
- **Implementation Invariance**: Functionally equivalent models should have identical attributions

#### 3.6.2 IG Formula
IG(x, b, f) = (x - b) ∫₀¹ ∇_x f(α·x + (1-α)·b) dα

**Components**:
- x: Input image
- b: Baseline (e.g., black image)
- α: Interpolation constant [0,1]
- Integration approximated using Riemann sum

#### 3.6.3 Baseline Selection
- **Black image**: Common but contains "black" information
- **Blurred image**: Removes high-frequency details
- **Uniform noise**: Random baseline
- **Training distribution**: Multiple baselines for robustness

### 3.7 Fast Integrated Gradients (𝒳-Gradients)

#### 3.7.1 Problem
- IG requires 50-200 forward passes
- Computationally expensive for real-time applications

#### 3.7.2 Solution: Nonnegative Homogeneity
- Remove bias terms from network: α(Wx) = W(αx)
- For nonnegatively homogeneous networks: IG = Input × Gradient
- Significant speedup with minimal accuracy loss

#### 3.7.3 𝒳-Network Properties
- Equivariant to contrast changes
- Fast axiomatic attribution
- Small accuracy drop (typically <1% on ImageNet)

**Q10: Explain the ProtoPNet architecture and training process in detail.**

**A10**: 

**Architecture**:
1. **Convolutional backbone f**: Standard CNN (VGG, ResNet) mapping input to H×W×D features
2. **Prototype layer**: m prototypes P = {p_j} of size 1×1×D representing prototypical patterns
3. **Prototype units g_p_j**: Compute similarity between prototypes and all spatial locations
4. **Global max pooling**: Reduces similarity maps to single prototype activation scores
5. **Fully connected layer h**: Uses prototype activations for final classification

**Training Process**:

**Stage 1 - SGD of early layers**:
- Optimize: CE + λ₁·Clst + λ₂·Sep

- Discourage negative reasoning: "class k because NOT prototype j"

**Visualization**: 
- Upsample prototype activation maps to image size
- Show 95% activation region as explanation
- Display corresponding training patch that prototype represents

### Chapter 5: Model-Agnostic Methods

**Q11: Explain the LIME algorithm for image classification step by step.**

**A11**: 

**Step 1: Problem Setup**
- Input: Image I to explain, black-box model f, class c
- Goal: Local linear approximation of f around I

**Step 2: Interpretable Representation**
- Segment image into superpixels using algorithms like SLIC
- Create binary vector z where z_i = 1 if superpixel i is present

**Step 3: Perturbation Generation**
- Generate N random binary vectors z'
- Create perturbed images I' by masking corresponding superpixels
- Typically N = 1000-5000 samples

**Step 4: Model Evaluation**
- Get predictions f(I') for all perturbed images
- Compute proximity weights π_x(z') = exp(-D(z,z')²/σ²)
- D measures distance between original and perturbed instances

**Step 5: Local Model Training**
- Fit sparse linear model: minimize Σ π_x(z')[f(z') - g(z')]² + λ||w||₁
- g(z') = w^T z' (linear model in interpretable space)
- λ controls sparsity (typically want K ≈ 5-10 active features)

**Step 6: Explanation Generation**
- Use linear coefficients w as importance scores
- Positive weights: superpixels supporting the prediction
- Negative weights: superpixels opposing the prediction
- Visualize by highlighting important superpixels

**Q12: Compare LIME and RISE across multiple dimensions.**

**A12**: 

| Dimension | LIME | RISE |
|-----------|------|------|
| **Core Assumption** | Local linearity | None (model-agnostic sampling) |
| **Perturbation Method** | Superpixel masking | Random smooth masks |
| **Output Type** | Binary importance map | Continuous attribution map |
| **Explanation Model** | Local linear regression | Weighted mask averaging |
| **Computational Cost** | High (local model training) | Medium (many forward passes) |
| **Stability** | Low (sensitive to perturbations) | Higher (averaging effect) |
| **Fidelity** | Medium (linearity assumption) | Higher (no model assumptions) |
| **Comprehensibility** | High (binary superpixel explanations) | Medium (continuous heatmaps) |
| **Hyperparameters** | Many (kernel, complexity, segmentation) | Few (mask size, number of samples) |

**Key Advantages**:
- **LIME**: More interpretable binary explanations, works well when linearity holds
- **RISE**: More faithful (no linearity assumption), more stable, fewer hyperparameters

**When to Use**:
- **LIME**: When you need clearly interpretable binary explanations and suspect local linearity
- **RISE**: When you need faithful explanations and don't want to assume local linearity

**Q13: What are the benefits and limitations of B-cos networks?**

**A13**: 

**Benefits**:

1. **Inherent Interpretability**:
   - Built-in explanation through dynamic linearity y(x) = W(x)x
   - No post-hoc approximation needed
   - Explanations are exact model summaries

2. **Alignment Pressure**:
   - Encourages meaningful weight-input alignment
   - Results in more human-interpretable features
   - Class-specific explanations naturally emerge

3. **Competitive Performance**:
   - Minimal accuracy loss compared to standard networks
   - Compatible with existing architectures (CNNs, Transformers)
   - Easy to implement with existing frameworks

4. **Evaluation Advantages**:
   - Performs well on quantitative interpretability metrics
   - More stable explanations across similar inputs
   - Clear mathematical foundation

**Limitations**:

1. **Architecture Modification**:
   - Requires replacing standard operations with B-cos transformations
   - May need retraining existing models
   - Not directly applicable to pre-trained models

2. **Potential Failure Cases**:
   - May learn bias terms through spatial features
   - Explanations might be faithful but not intuitive
   - Requires careful loss function design

3. **Limited Evaluation**:
   - Relatively new approach with limited long-term studies
   - May not work equally well across all domains
   - Needs more comprehensive evaluation

4. **Design Constraints**:
   - Optimization objective influences explanation quality
   - "You get what you ask for" - explanations reflect training objectives
   - May require domain-specific adjustments

**Overall Assessment**: B-cos networks represent a promising approach to inherent interpretability, offering a middle ground between post-hoc explanations and fully interpretable models, but require careful implementation and evaluation.
